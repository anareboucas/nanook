  "body": "### Overview\r\n        \tNanook is a robot made by NASA summer interns in a bootcamp led by Michael Comberiate (NASA-Mike). Three robots (Nanook, Penguin 1 and Penguin 2) were developed to explore a remote terrain, while challenging communication protocols, large data transference, and ability to work in harsh environments.\r\n\r\n        \tAccording to P. Stakem [1], the goal of the project was “to assemble a networked team of autonomous robots to be used for three-dimensional terrain mapping, high-resolution imaging, and sample collection in unexplored territories.” The mothership (Nanook) was responsible for locating their auxiliar robots (Penguin 1 and 2) based on sphere detection (each auxiliar robot had unique spheres placed at their top). They tracked an area sending stitched successive images to the control center, where high level strategy was decided and sent as commands to the robots. The robots are semi-autonomous requiring a minimal command from the control center.\r\n\r\n        \tA lot of incredible pioneer work was done during the few weeks of the NASA Engineering Bootcamp, but a good documentation about this project was not developed concomitantly.\r\n\r\n        \tAlmost five years after the end of Nanook’s project, a reverse engineering project is being developed to document it. Characterized by “taking apart an object to see how it works in order to duplicate or enhance”[2] it, a reverse engineering project allows the reconnaissance of the entire system and its characterization for further consultancy and implementation by establishing the adequate documentation.\r\n\r\n\tThree students from Federal University of Ceará are the ones working with this reverse engineering project.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis reverse engineering project was developed by:\r\n\r\nAna Beatriz Prudêncio de Almeida Rebouças (@anareboucas),\r\n\r\nNadson Renan Tomé de Souza (@NadsonR), and\r\n\r\nThiago Alves Lima (@ThiagoAlvesLima).",
