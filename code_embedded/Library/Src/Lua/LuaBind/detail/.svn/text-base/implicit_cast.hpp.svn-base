	// the pointer have to be offseted to perform the cast
	// the reason why we return the number of cast-steps times two, instead of
	// just the number of steps is to be consistent with the function matchers. They
	// have to give one matching-point extra to match const functions. There may be
	// two functions that match their parameters exactly, but there is one const
	// function and one non-const function, then (if the this-pointer is non-const)
	// both functions will match. To avoid amiguaties, the const version will get
	// one penalty point to make the match-selector select the non-const version. It
	// the this-pointer is const, there's no problem, since the non-const function
	// will not match at all.
