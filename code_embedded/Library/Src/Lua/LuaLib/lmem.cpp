** About the realloc function:
** void * frealloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize, size_t nsize);
** (`osize' is the old size, `nsize' is the new size)
**
** Lua ensures that (ptr == NULL) iff (osize == 0).
**
** * frealloc(ud, NULL, 0, x) creates a new block of size `x'
**
** * frealloc(ud, p, x, 0) frees the block `p'
** (in this specific case, frealloc must return NULL).
** particularly, frealloc(ud, NULL, 0, 0) does nothing
** (which is equivalent to free(NULL) in ANSI C)
**
** frealloc returns NULL if it cannot create or reallocate the area
** (any reallocation to an equal or smaller size cannot fail!)
